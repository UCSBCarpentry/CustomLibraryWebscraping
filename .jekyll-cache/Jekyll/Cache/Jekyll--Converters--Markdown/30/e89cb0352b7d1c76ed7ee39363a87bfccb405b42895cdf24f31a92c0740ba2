<p>In order to follow this lesson, you will need to make sure the following software is installed on your computer.</p>

<h2 id="part-one-manually-scrape-data-using-browser-extensions">Part one: Manually scrape data using browser extensions</h2>

<p>For the first half of the lesson, we will use a Chrome browser extension to get started with web scraping.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Please ensure you have a working copy of the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Chrome browser</a>.</li>
  <li>Using Chrome, download and enable the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scraper/mbigbapnjcgaffohmbkdlecaccepngjd">Scraper extension</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="part-two-write-python-programs-to-automatically-scrape-data">Part two: Write Python programs to automatically scrape data</h2>

<h3 id="shell-and-python">Shell and Python</h3>
<p>The second part of the lesson requires the Python programming language and access to a command-line interface (shell) on your computer.
Please refer to <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/workshop-template/#setup">the Software Carpentry setup instructions</a> for
<em>the Bash shell</em> and <em>Python</em> if you need guidance.</p>

<blockquote class="prereq">
  <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
  <p>This part of the lesson requires some prior knowledge of Python and how to use a shell.
If you need help getting started on those topics, we suggest going through the following
lessons first (during a workshop or on your own):</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/">The Unix Shell</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/">Programming with Python</a></li>
  </ul>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="scrapy">Scrapy</h3>

<p>Once you have a working installation of Python, the next step is to install <a href="https://scrapy.org/">Scrapy</a>.</p>

<p>If you have installed Python using the Anaconda framework as suggested by the Software Carpentry setup instructions,
you can easilly install Scrapy by doing the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open a new shell (e.g. Terminal on Mac, or the Anaconda command-line tool on Windows)</li>
  <li>Type the following:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote class="source">
  <p>conda install scrapy</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, if you have another distribution of Python, you can try using pip:</p>

<blockquote class="source">
  <p>pip install Scrapy</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If you run into issues while installing Scrapy, refer to the
<a href="https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html#intro-install">official Scrapy install guide</a>
or get in touch with your lesson instructor.</p>
